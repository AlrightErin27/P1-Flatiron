  - Feature 1: <u>The Goodest Dog of the Day</u> shows random image of dog as breaking news.
  - Feature 2: <u>Dog User Profile</u> where the dog can add their profile picture and personal info.
  - Feature 3: <u>Dog's Friend's List</u> shows dogs from local database (photos, comments, description & likes).

### Stretch Goals:
